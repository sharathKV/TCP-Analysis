# Analysis of TCP Cubic and TCP DCTCP in NS3 simulator
In this project, I have assessed the performance of TCP Cubic and DCTCP in terms of throughput and average flow completion time. 
I have implemented a dumbbell topology in the ns-3 simulator. 
I have ran multiple experiments to evaluate the performance of both TCP versions for the given metrics. 
I have tried to demonstrate how well these two protocols coexist with each other and which one performs better in terms of responding to the congestion in the network.

## Measurement Metrics
- **Throughput** tells how much data is transferred per unit time from source to destination over a given period of time. Its unit is bits per second (bps).
- **Average Flow Completion Time** measures the time taken by the sender to send the desired amount of data to the receiver. It is measured in seconds
