In this project, I have assessed the performance of TCP Cubic and DCTCP in terms of throughput and average flow completion time. 
I have implemented a dumbbell topology in the ns-3 simulator. 
I have ran multiple experiments to evaluate the performance of both TCP versions for the given metrics. 
I have tried to demonstrate how well these two protocols coexist with each other and which one performs better in terms of responding to the congestion in the network.
